QuizOfQuints
============

Learning music theory through quizzes, starting with a basic circle of quints. The start of this game is to allow a student to play a 'guessing game' to improve knowledge of musical keys.

I hope to be adding such things as 'achievements' and 'quests', since this is a strong encouragement factor in 'gamification'. However this would require me to start running a server, and more importantly a database. If overly succcessful, this will cost money...

As I am still looking into building a server component I cannot shed any light on it, other than that it will require setting up configurations outside of the codebase. The client code can simply be run by downloading and opening the index.html
